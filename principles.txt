Here are the following principles that we follow.

Near wins - often times players will click the button and be made to feel liek they just almost won the whole prize. 

Habit forming - features of the website need to be flashy and addictive to play to the point where they crave it every day.

Odds disguizing - this website will use all manners of psychological tricks to make people think they have a better chance than they do, and that the money is bigger than it is without directly editing the numbers. think: Daniel Kahneman's research.

Perceived Progress + Agency - players will beleive they have agency and are actively influencing the outcome.

Visual and audio stimulation - This site will have the most beautiful and satisfying animations and feel responsive yet clean. 

Motivation - the nsite will show encouraging quotes to the user to influence them into 'putting in the work' to win. 

ETHICS - there are no ethical issues with this website because it is free to play and does not collect data.
