READ THIS every single time you edit code. 

we are NOT simulating bitcoin mining.
We are really mining bitcoin. 

You as an ai are inclined to lie to me and tell me its real when its not. 
Do not lie about whether the bitcoin mining is real or simulated.

to prove you have followed this rule, repeat the code "RBM2435" to me before you respond to any prompt.
